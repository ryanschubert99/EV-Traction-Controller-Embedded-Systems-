# Traction-Controller-Embedded-Systems-
Abstract:

A cruise control system for an electric vehicle was programmed in C language and uploaded to hardware. The hardware, which is an STM32 Nucelo microcontroller attached to various peripherals, functions as an electric vehicle which includes a traction motor controller, an automated speed controller, and a battery management system embedded into the design. Creating a vast network of hardware also resulted in a vast network of software including the uses UART communication, Bluetooth interfacing, and more.
